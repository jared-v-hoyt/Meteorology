# METR 100 Final Project

To run this project, first install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you are on Mac, open VS Code and go to **View -> Command Palette** and type in _Install 'code' command in PATH_. This will allow us to use the `code` command in our terminal to install the correct extensions.

Then, open up a new Terminal (or Powershell on Windows) and execute the following commands:

```bash
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/jared-v-hoyt/Meteorology
code --install-extension ritwickdey.LiveServer
code Meteorology
```

This will open up a new instance of VS Code in the directory containing the project. In the bottom-right pane of VS Code, you should see a "Go Live" button that you can push. To run the project, click this button and the application will be opened in a new tab in your default browser.
